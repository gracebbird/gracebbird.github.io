I worked as a cashier and walked customers through the menu in an understandable and concise manner, helped them customize their ice cream, and would then roll their ice cream from scratch, taking care to present it in an aesthetic fashion.

    <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
    Throughout my highschool experience I fostered skills working in a variety of clubs and alongside different people. Some of these include 
I have just over two years of full time work experience and in that time have become skilled at socializing with patrons, multitasking, and problem solving. Previous to this I took orchestra and creative writing and am well equipped with a creative, patient, and vibrant world view. Learning and growing within a position is valuable to me, and I always appreciate a chance to approach issues with gumption. </br>
